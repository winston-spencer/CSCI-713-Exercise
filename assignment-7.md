## Summary

**JaCoCo Results:**
- Overall Line Coverage: 100%
- Overall Branch Coverage: [Insert percentage]

**PIT Mutation Testing Results:**
- Overall Mutation Score: 96% (24/25 mutations killed)
- Surviving Mutations: 1 (ConditionalsBoundaryMutator in Student.setAge)

## Notes

The project achieves excellent code coverage with JaCoCo showing 100% line coverage across all classes. PIT mutation testing reveals a 96% mutation score, with only one surviving mutation that appears to be equivalent (both original and mutated code produce the same observable behavior).
